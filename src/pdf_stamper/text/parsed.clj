;; Filling parsed text holes involves a lot of extra processing of the page contents. The input data is required to be a top-level XML-tag containing the actual paragraphs as children.
;; Each paragraph can contain any number of arbitrarily nested character-level tags that must be parsed and represented correctly.

;; ## Internal representation
;;
;; While input to the parsed text holes is XML, internally it is converted to a different representation that better supports splitting the
;; contents of tags over multiple lines.
;;
;; The general structure of the internal representation of an XML string is as a seq of the representations of paragraph-level tags.
;; Paragraph-level tags are represented as maps with the keys `:elem` and `:content`. The element type defines the final output when a line
;; of that paragraph is stamped onto a PDF. The contents is either a single string (wrapped in a seq) or a seq of strings interleaved with character-level tags.
;; Character-level tags are represented as maps as well, but they have the key `:style` instead of `:elem`. The style is a vector of possible styles,
;; where the default is `:regular`. If `:regular` is present there can be no other styles in the vector.

  representation."

;; ### Character-level tags

(defn- inline-tag-one
  "Converting character-level tags to the internal
  representation involves handling nested character-level
  tags.

  Remember that the contents of a tag is always a
  seq. This function handles exactly on piece of the
  content seq, such that `contents` here is always a string
  (no nested tag) or a map (a nested tag).

  In the case of nested tags the new style is `conj`ed onto
  the style of the nested tag. This is also where the requirement
  that the `:regular` style cannot be present at the same
  time as other styles is enforced. Since `:regular` is never
  added by a tag, it is safe to assume that removing it this
  once is enough.

  If `contents` is not a nested tag the style is simply set to
  `[style]`."
  [contents style]
  (if-let [content-style (:style contents)]
    {:style (conj (if (= content-style [:regular])
                    []

          contents-s))

(defn- inline-tag
  "When building the internal representation of a character-level
  tag, it is necessary to take into account the entire content
  vector. Regardless of whether there are one or many character-
  level tags in the content vector, the resulting internal

  `content-vec`."

;; - `:head-1`

(def h3-tag ^:private (paragraph-tag :head-3))

;; ### Putting it all together
;;
;; Texts are parsed using clojure.data.xml, so the main part of converting to the internal representation is being able to convert the XML datastructure.
;; Every `clojure.data.xml.Element` has some `:content`, which is a seq of strings and other xml elements. If the element is not of a supported type
;; the tag is stripped and the representation is built for the contents instead. This ensures that no meaning is dropped from a sentence, only markup.
;;
;; Supported XML tags are:
;;
;; - `<b>`
;; - `<strong>`
;; - `<i>`
;; - `<em>`
;; - `<ul>`
;; - `<ol>`
;; - `<p>`
;; - `<h1>`
;; - `<h2>`
;; - `<h3>`
;;
;; The semantics of each tag follow HTML, e.g. `<ul>` is an unordered list.
;;
;; *Future*: Ordered lists, i.e. `:number` in the internal representation, are not yet fully supported. Actually printing numbers instead of just bullets is missing.
