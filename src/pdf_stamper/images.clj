(defn- scale-dimensions
  "To calculate the new dimensions for scaled images, the image
  is first scaled such that the height fits into the available
  bounds. If the image width is still larger than it should be,
  it means that the scaling factor for the width is larger than
  for the height, and we use that to compute a new height.

  The arguments are passed as a map to provide some context to
  the four numbers, as it is otherwise too easy to mix up the
  parameters when applying this function.
  
  *Future*: Going by the description above it should be possible
  to refactor this to compute both scaling factors up front, and
  simply use the largest."

  defines whether the image is shrunk to fit, or aspect ratio is

  `:preserve` being the default.

  It is possible to specify the quality of the stamped image by
  setting the `:quality` key to a value between `0.0` and `1.0`. The
  default quality if not specified is `0.75`.
