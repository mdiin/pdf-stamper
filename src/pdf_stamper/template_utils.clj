;; In some situations, templates in pdf-stamper can become difficult to maintain. One such
;; situation can occur when you have a number of template parts that combine with each other to
;; form the final templates. If the template parts form semantic "layers", and each part of
;; a layer needs to be combined with all parts of the following layer, we get an exponential
;; explosion in the number of templates. Since there is a direction in the way parts are combined
;; the final templates can be described by a number of trees, where each path from a leaf to the
;; root describes one template.
;;
;; To avoid having to write an exponential number of template descriptions by hand, this namespace
;; provides utilities that allow you to specify how the semantic layers relate to each other.

;; ## The zipper
;;
;; Since we are looking at trees, we use `clojure.zip` as an efficient way to manipulate the trees.
;; We need some helpers to make the zippers easier to work with in this context.
;;
;; First, we define what a zipper of template parts is.

;; ### Subtrees
;;
;; Since we cannot rely on a regular depth-first traversal of the trees when inserting new parts,
;; we define ways to travel around subtrees.
;;
;; We always add to leaves, and the final templates are constructed from the leaf paths, so an easy
;; way to access leaves is needed.

;; operations only travel to siblings, some way to find the next subtree that contains leaves
;; is needed.
