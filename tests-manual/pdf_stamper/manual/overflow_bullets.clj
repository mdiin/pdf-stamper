;; This is a test designed to show overflowing of multi-line text holes, i.e. holes of type `:text-parsed`.
;; Specifically, this test is about breaking bullet points over multiple pages.
;;
;; An image with solid colour is placed as the background of the text holes, such that we can visually spot whether the
;; text fits within the box.
